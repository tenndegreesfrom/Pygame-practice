## Welcome! ##
This is my first project from the [Caribbean Coding Workshop: CCW 002 Course](caribbeanscience.org/coding-workshop/).  The goal was to create a simple text-based Hangman game.  
As part of the game, a file containing text would be loaded.  The program would select a random word from the file, with the condition that it would be greater than 3 characters.  
The game will let you know how many letters are in the word.  
Type your chosen letter, and the game will let you know if the guess is correct or incorrect.  
You can make 7 incorrect guesses before the game is over, each incorrect guess results in a new body part generating.
Correct letters are shown in the word, incorrect letters are shown in the relevant section.
Once the game is over, you may chose if you would like to play again.  
**Good luck! :)**
